/**
 *  Floydâ€™s slow and fast pointers approach to detect the loop
 *
 *  The algorithm is to start two pointers, slow and fast from head of linked list.
 *  We move slow one node at a time and fast two nodes at a time. If there is a loop, then they will definitely meet.
 *  This approach works because of the following facts. 1) When slow pointer enters the loop,
 *  the fast pointer must be inside the loop. Let fast pointer be distance k from slow.
 *  2) Now if consider movements of slow and fast pointers, we can notice that distance between them (from slow to fast)
 *  increase by one after every iteration. After one iteration (of slow = next of slow and fast = next of next of fast),
 *  distance between slow and fast becomes k+1, after two iterations, k+2, and so on. When distance becomes n,
 *  they meet because they are moving in a cycle of length n. For example, we can see in below diagram,
 *  initial distance is 2. After one iteration, distance becomes 3, after 2 iterations, it becomes 4.
 *  After 3 iterations, it becomes 5 which is distance 0. And they meet.
